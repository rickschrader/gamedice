Game Dice
=========

Game Dice is an animated polyhedral dice roller for those who play table top role playing games or board games, or even people who have trouble making decisions. It will roll dice in all the common polyhedral flavors (d3, d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20, and d100), and of any quantity.

The screen is divided into three sections:

* The top most section is the menu bar containing the current time (so you know when to order your pizza) and battery status (if low).
* The second section, with the white background, contains the result of the dice roll -- with an animated fly in.
* The lower black section contains both the dice being rolled in standard dice notation (1d20, 8d100, 2d4, etc.) and the button mode -- #d for changing the number of dice to roll, and d# for changing the sides on the dice being rolled.

To use:
* Select Button (long press) - Roll the die!
* Select Button (normal press) - Switch between updating the dice's sides (d#), and the quantity of dice to roll (#d)
* Up Button - Increase the dice's sides (d#) or dice quantity (#d). Hold this button for speedy changes.
* Down Button - Decrease the dice's sides (d#) or dice quantity (#d). Hold this button for speedy changes.

Updates
